This is the python code for A neural network learning algorithm for highly imbalanced data classification. Our original tested results can be seen in the Results/paper_results.  

In this paper, we tested NN_HIDC on 34 imbalanced datasets. To run the code, for instance, the hidc method in abalone_3_vs_11_5_fold, you can run the corresponding train_hidc.py. Then, you can obtain a log file in the log_hidc/log_hidc.txt file in current directory.

After all the tests are done,  you can directly run test_all_dataset_HIDC.py to obtain the final results.
